# Temperance SPARC 
Temperance SPARC is a software aimed to automate the testing of touchscreens through a 3-axis cartesian robot.

The Temperance software allows a versatile serial monitor to testing device interface. It was built, and is currently being updated, to cover a wide variety of cartesian robots.
## News
### Temperance SPARC 1.0
SPARC was originally intended as a complete solution which included mechanic, electronic and programming implementation. The software, however, was designed to overcome changes in any of these areas. The Temperance software architecture can be quickly adapted to most cartesian robots, as long as the PIC18F4550 remains at its core. 

Official updates will only be available [here](https://github.com/DenisseRamirez/temperancetarea1).
## Events
SPARC will be formally presented on December, 12th 2019.
## Features
The Temperance software has the following features:
- Comprehensive list of commands to perform common human actions such as taps and gestures. 
- Detection of common error inputs.
- Serial feedback upon reception and completion of commands for easy automation.
- Full control of 3-axes (defined as X, Y and Z)
- 16 EEPROM slots to save 3-coordinates setpoints.
- Classic closed-loop control for the Z axis.
